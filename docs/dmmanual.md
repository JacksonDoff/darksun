# Dark Sun Dungeon Master's Manual

If you are scripting for us, you should also be familiar with the [player's manual](playersmanual.md), the [dungeon master's manual](dmmanual.md) and [builder's manual](buildersmanual.md).  Each of these publications build on each other.  Everything in those manuals will ensure you're familiar with the systems present in this module and how they are used.  This manual will specifically introduce you to the expected scripting style as well as some of the advanced features of the framework and other systems.

## Expectations

As a volunteer project, we fully expect that any person that works on this project will not be around forever.  With that in mind, we expect everyone that contributes to the project to adhere to specific customs and styles so that future contributors can easily read the code and understand what is going on.  Here's a list of general expectations for scripting:





## Questions

If you have any questions about installing these tools, and you're sure you followed the instructions above correctly, you're best bet is to get onto the [Dark Sun discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/468225176773984256/468225176773984258) and ask a question about installing the tools.  If you're not a member of our discord, you can [join](https://discord.gg/8ZxgMRc).  If you tag me (@tinygiant) in your post, I'll likely answer pretty quickly.  If you don't tag me, I may not see the question at all, but one of our many other team members might be able to help.  I'm happy to answer discord DMs also if you don't want to join the discord.

## Conclusion

I know this was a lot of information, but, again, it all boils down to just a few commands once you're used to it.  The majority of this tutorial is aimed at our audience that is new to this process.  If you've decided to use VS Code, which can accomplish a lot of these steps in a visual environment, please read the [~~VS Code Tutorial~~coming soon](vscode.md).  This is not really necessary for most content developers, but if you're a scripter, I highly recommend your consider VS Code as your primary development environment for this module.
